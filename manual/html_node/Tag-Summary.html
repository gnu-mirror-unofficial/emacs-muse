<h3 class="section">8.16 Tags that Muse recognizes</h3>

<p><a name="index-tags-87"></a><a name="index-inserting-files-at-publish-time-88"></a><a name="index-publishing_002c-including-markup-in-headers-and-footers-89"></a><a name="index-publishing_002c-inserting-files-90"></a>
Muse has several built-in tags that may prove useful during publishing. 
See <a href="muse_002dpublish_002dmarkup_002dtags.html#muse_002dpublish_002dmarkup_002dtags">muse-publish-markup-tags</a>, to see how to customize the tags that
Muse uses, as well as make your own tags.

   <p>Only a small subset of these tags are available in header and footer
text.  The <code>muse-publish-markup-header-footer-tags</code> option lists
the tags that are allowed in headers and footers.

<h4 class="subheading">Syntax</h4>

<p>If a tag takes arguments, it will look like this, where &ldquo;tagname&rdquo; is
the name of the tag.

<pre class="example">     &lt;tagname arg1="string1" arg2="string2"&gt;
</pre>
   <p>If you want the tag to look like it came straight from an XHTML
document, you can alternatively do the following.

<pre class="example">     &lt;tagname arg1="string1" arg2="string2" /&gt;
</pre>
   <p>If a tag surrounds some text, it will look like this.

<pre class="example">     &lt;tagname&gt;Some text&lt;/tagname&gt;
</pre>
   <p>If a tag surrounds a large region, it will look like this.

<pre class="example">     &lt;tagname&gt;
     Some text.
     Some more text.
     &lt;/tagname&gt;
</pre>
   <h4 class="subheading">Tag listing</h4>

<p>This is the complete list of tags that Muse accepts, including those
that were mentioned in previous sections.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;br&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Insert a line break.

     <p>Muse will automatically detect paragraphs when publishing by means of
blank lines, so this tag is usually unnecessary.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;cite&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Insert a citation to another source.

     <p>This takes the argument <samp><span class="option">type</span></samp>, which indicates the type of
citation.  The valid types are "author" and "year".  If this argument is
omitted, include both author and year in the citation.

     <p>The bibliography to use for the citation may be specified by the
<samp><span class="option">#bibsource</span></samp> directive.

     <p>See <a href="Citations.html#Citations">Citations</a>, for additional information.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;class&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If publishing to HTML, surround the given text with a <tt>&lt;span></tt>
tag.  It takes one argument called &ldquo;name&rdquo; that specifies the &ldquo;class&rdquo;
attribute of the <tt>&lt;span></tt> tag.

     <p>If publishing to a different format, do nothing extra to the text.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;code&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Treat the text surrounded by the tag as if they were enclosed in equal
signs, that is, make it monospace.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;command&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Run a command on the region, replacing the region with the result of the
command.  The command is specified with the &ldquo;interp&rdquo; argument.  If no
value for &ldquo;interp&rdquo; is given, pass the entire region to the shell.

     <p>The &ldquo;markup&rdquo; argument controls how this section is marked up.

     <p>If it is omitted, publish the region with the normal Muse rules.

     <p>If "nil", do not mark up the region at all, but prevent Muse from
further interpreting it.

     <p>If "example", treat the region as if it was surrounded by the
<tt>&lt;example></tt> tag.

     <p>If "src", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
<tt>&lt;src></tt> tag.  You should also specify the &ldquo;lang&rdquo; attribute if
doing this.

     <p>If "verse", treat the region as if it was surrounded by the
<tt>&lt;verse></tt> tag, to preserve newlines.

     <p>Otherwise, it should be the name of a function to call, with the buffer
narrowed to the region.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;comment&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Treat the entire region as a comment.  If the option
<var>muse-publish-comments-p</var> is nil, delete the region, otherwise
publish it using the comment syntax of the current publishing style.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;contents&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Publish a Table of Contents.  This will either be inserted in-place or
at the beginning of the document, depending on your publishing style. 
It does not have a delimiting tag.

     <p>By default, only 2 levels of headings will be included in the generated
Table of Contents.  To change this globally, customize the
<var>muse-publish-contents-depth</var> option.  To change this only for the
current tag, use the &ldquo;depth&rdquo; argument.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;div&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Insert a &lt;div&gt; tag into HTML documents, and do not insert anything
special for other non-HTML publishing formats.

     <p>If the &ldquo;style&rdquo; argument is provided, include it with the published
<tt>&lt;div></tt> tag.  Likewise for the &ldquo;id&rdquo; argument.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;example&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Publish the region in monospace, preserving the newlines in the region. 
This is useful for snippets of code.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;include&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Insert the given file at the current location during publishing.  The
basic use of this tag is as follows, replacing &ldquo;included_file&rdquo; with
the name of the file that you want to include.

     <pre class="example">          &lt;include file="included_file"&gt;
</pre>
     <p>The &ldquo;markup&rdquo; argument controls how this section is marked up.

     <p>If it is omitted, publish the included text with the normal Muse
rules.

     <p>If "nil", do not mark up the included text at all.

     <p>If "example", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
<tt>&lt;example></tt> tag.

     <p>If "src", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
<tt>&lt;src></tt> tag.  You should also specify the &ldquo;lang&rdquo; attribute if
doing this.

     <p>If "verse", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
<tt>&lt;verse></tt> tag, to preserve newlines.

     <p>Otherwise, it should be the name of a function to call after inserting
the file with the buffer narrowed to the section inserted.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;lisp&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Evaluate the Emacs Lisp expressions between the initial and ending tags. 
The result is then inserted into the document, so you do not need to
explicitly call <code>insert</code>.  All text properties are removed from the
resulting text.

     <p>This tag takes the &ldquo;markup&rdquo; argument.  See the description of
<tt>&lt;command></tt> for details.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;literal&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Make sure that the text enclosed by this tag is published without
escaping it in any way.  This is useful for inserting markup directly
into the published document, when Muse does not provide the desired
functionality.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;markup&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Mark up the text between the initial and ending tags.  The markup
command to use may be specified by the &ldquo;function&rdquo; argument.  The
standard Muse markup routines are used by default if no &ldquo;function&rdquo;
argument is provided.

     <p>This is useful for marking up regions in headers and footers.  One
example that comes to mind is generating a published index of all of the
files in the current project by doing the following.

     <pre class="example">          &lt;markup&gt;&lt;lisp&gt;(muse-index-as-string t t)&lt;/lisp&gt;&lt;/markup&gt;
</pre>
     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;perl&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Run the <samp><span class="command">perl</span></samp> language interpreter on the region, replacing the
region with the result of the command.

     <p>This tag takes the &ldquo;markup&rdquo; argument.  See the description of
<tt>&lt;command></tt> for details.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;python&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Run the <samp><span class="command">python</span></samp> language interpreter on the region, replacing
the region with the result of the command.

     <p>This tag takes the &ldquo;markup&rdquo; argument.  See the description of
<tt>&lt;command></tt> for details.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;quote&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Publish the region as a blockquote.  This will either be inserted
in-place or at the beginning of the document, depending on your
publishing style.  It does not have a delimiting tag.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;ruby&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Run the <samp><span class="command">ruby</span></samp> language interpreter on the region, replacing the
region with the result of the command.

     <p>This tag takes the &ldquo;markup&rdquo; argument.  See the description of
<tt>&lt;command></tt> for details.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;src&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Publish the region using htmlize. 
The language to use may be specified by the &ldquo;lang&rdquo; attribute.

     <p>Muse will look for a function named <var>lang</var>-mode, where <var>lang</var> is
the value of the &ldquo;lang&rdquo; attribute.

     <p>This tag requires htmlize 1.34 or later in order to work.  If this is
not satisfied, or the current publishing style is not HTML-based, Muse
will publish the region like an <tt>&lt;example></tt> tag.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;verbatim&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is used when you want to prevent Muse from trying to interpret some
markup.  Surround the markup in <tt>&lt;verbatim></tt> and
<tt>&lt;/verbatim></tt>, and it will not be interpreted.

     <p>This tag was used often in previous versions of Muse because they did
not support whole-document escaping of specials.  Now, it will only be
needed for other tags, and perhaps footnotes as well.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;verse&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Preserve the newlines in the region.  In formats like HTML, newlines are
removed by default, hence the need for this tag.  In other publishing
styles, this tag may cause the text to be indented slightly in a way
that looks nice for poetry and prose.
