<h4 class="subsection">9.1.1 Other tools needed for the Blosxom style</h4>

<p>You will need to have <samp><span class="command">pyblosxom.cgi</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">blosxom.cgi</span></samp>
installed on a machine that you have upload access to.

   <p>The major difficulty in both of these programs is specifying the date of
the entries.  Both programs rely on the file modification time rather
than any data contained in the entries themselves.  A plugin is needed
in order for these programs to be able to get the correct date.

<h4 class="subheading">PyBlosxom</h4>

<p>There are two different ways of accomplishing this in pyblosxom.  The
first way involves gathering the timestamps (as specified by the
<code>#date</code> directive) into one file and then sending that file along
with published entries to the webserver.

   <p>The second will read each file at render time and parse the
<code>#postdate</code> directive.  Muse will translate the <code>#date</code>
directive into <code>#postdate</code> at publish time, so you don't have to do
any extra work.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Placing timestamps in one file</h5>

<p>The following additional components are required in order to make the
date of blog entries display as something sensible.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A script to gather date directives from the entire blog tree into a
single file.  The file must associate a blog entry with a date.

     <li>A plugin for (py)blosxom that reads this file.
        </ol>

   <p>These 2 things are provided for <samp><span class="command">pyblosxom.cgi</span></samp> in the
<samp><span class="file">contrib/pyblosxom</span></samp> subdirectory.  <samp><span class="file">getstamps.py</span></samp> provides the
former service, while <samp><span class="file">hardcodedates.py</span></samp> provides the latter
service.

   <p>Here is a sample listing from my <samp><span class="file">timestamps</span></samp> file, which maps
each file to a date.  This can really be in any format, as long as your
date-gathering script and your plugin can both understand it.

<pre class="example">     2005-04-01-14-16 personal/paper_cranes
     2005-03-21 personal/spring_break_over
     2004-10-24 personal/finished_free_culture
</pre>
   <p>The script <samp><span class="file">contrib/pyblosxom/make-blog</span></samp> demonstrates how to call
<samp><span class="file">getstamps.py</span></samp>.  Note that you will need to set the current
directory to where your Muse files are, execute <samp><span class="file">getstamps.py</span></samp>, and
then move the generated timestamps file to your publishing directory.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Getting timestamp from entry while rendering</h5>

<p>Alternately, the pyblosxom metadate plugin may be used.  On the plus
side, there is no need to run a script to gather the date.  On the
downside, each entry is read twice rather than once when the page is
rendered.  Set the value of <code>muse-blosxom-use-metadate</code> to non-nil
to enable adding a <code>#postdate</code> directive to all published files. 
You can do this by:

<pre class="example">     M-x customize-variable RET muse-blosxom-use-metadate RET
</pre>
   <p>With the metadate plugin installed in pyblosxom, the date set in this
directive will be used instead of the file's modification time.  The
plugin is included with Muse at <samp><span class="file">contrib/pyblosxom/metadate.py</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subheading">Blosxom</h4>

<p>It is also possible to use Blosxom, which is written in Perl, to serve
blog entries that were published with Muse.  The steps are as follows.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Download and install blosxom from <a href="http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/">http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/</a>.

     <li>Install the metadate plugin.  It is available in
<samp><span class="file">contrib/blosxom/metadate_0_0_3</span></samp>.

     <li>Every time you make a new blog entry, change to the blosxom data
directory and execute the <samp><span class="file">contrib/blosxom/getstamps.pl</span></samp> script. 
This script has only recently been made, and may still have some bugs,
so use with caution.

        </ol>
