<h3 class="section">6.4 Listing of Available Options for Projects</h3>

<p><a name="index-projects_002c-options-22"></a><a name="index-muse_002dproject_002dalist_002c-reference-23"></a>
This is a listing of all of the various options (or, more accurately:
attributes) that may be specified in <code>muse-project-alist</code>.

   <p>Each muse-project-alist entry looks like this:

<pre class="example">       (PROJECT-NAME (SOURCES)
         OUTPUTS)
</pre>
   <p>We refer to these names below.

   <p>&ldquo;Attributes&rdquo;, which compose SOURCES and OUTPUTS, are a pair of values. 
The first value is a keyword, like <samp><span class="option">:default</span></samp>.  The second part
is the value associated with that keyword, such as the text &ldquo;index&rdquo;. 
If you are familiar with Emacs Lisp property lists, the concept is
similar to that, except that in the SOURCES section, single directories
can be interspersed with two-value attributes.

<h4 class="subheading">Project Name</h4>

<p>This is a string that indicates the name of the project.  It is
primarily used for publishing interwiki links with the
<samp><span class="file">muse-wiki.el</span></samp> module.

<h4 class="subheading">Sources</h4>

<p>This part of a muse-project-alist entry consists of two-value
attributes, and also directory names.  If you are publishing a book, the
order of directories and attributes is significant.

   <p>The minimal content for the sources section is a list of directories.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">:book-chapter</span></samp><dd>Indicates a new chapter of a book.  The text of the title of the chapter
comes immediately after this keyword.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:book-end</span></samp><dd>Indicates the end of a book.  Directories listed after this one are
ignored when publishing a book.  The value &ldquo;t&rdquo; (without quotes) should
come immediately after this keyword.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:book-funcall</span></samp><dd>A function to call while publishing a book.  This is useful for doing
something just after a particular chapter.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:book-part</span></samp><dd>Indicates the beginning of a new part of the book.  The text of the
title should come immediately after this keyword.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:book-style</span></samp><dd>Indicate a particular publishing style to use for this part of the book. 
If this is specified, it should come just after a <samp><span class="option">:part</span></samp>
attribute.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:default</span></samp><dd>The default page to visit when browsing a project.  Also, if you are
using the <samp><span class="file">muse-wiki.el</span></samp> module, publishing a link to just a
project's name will cause it to link to this default file.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:force-publish</span></samp><dd>This specifies a list of pages which should be published every time a
project is published (by using <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd>, for example), regardless
of whether their contents have changed.  This is useful for updating
Index pages, pages that use the <tt>&lt;include></tt> tag, and other pages
that have dynamically-generated content.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:major-mode</span></samp><dd>This specifies the major mode to use when visiting files in this
project.  The default is <code>muse-mode</code>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:nochapters</span></samp><dd>This indicates that while publishing a book, do not automatically create
chapters.  Values which may follow this are nil (the default, which
means that we automatically create chapters), or non-nil, which means
that we manually specify chapters with the <samp><span class="option">:book-chapter</span></samp>
attribute,

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:publish-project</span></samp><dd>Indicates which function we should call when publishing a project.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:set</span></samp><dd>This specifies a list of variables and values to set when publishing a
project.  The list should be a property list, which is in the form:

     <pre class="example">          (VAR1 VALUE1 VAR2 VALUE2 ...)
</pre>
     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:visit-link</span></samp><dd>Specifies the function to call when visiting a link.  The default is
<code>muse-visit-link-default</code>.  The arguments for that function should
be (1) the link and (2) whether to visit the link in a new window.

   </dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Outputs</h4>

<p>This part of a muse-project-alist entry is composed of lists of
attributes.  Each list is called an &ldquo;output style&rdquo;.

   <p>The minimal content for an output style is a <samp><span class="option">:base</span></samp> attribute
and a <samp><span class="option">:path</span></samp> attribute.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">:base</span></samp><dd>Publishing style to use, such as &ldquo;html&rdquo;, &ldquo;docbook&rdquo;, or &ldquo;pdf&rdquo;.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:base-url</span></samp><dd>An external URL which can be used to access published files.  This is
mainly used by the <samp><span class="file">muse-wiki</span></samp> module when publishing links between
two separate projects, if the projects are served on different domains.

     <p>It is also used by the <samp><span class="file">muse-journal</span></samp> module to create the RSS or
RDF output.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:exclude</span></samp><dd>Exclude items matching a regexp from being published.  The regexp should
usually begin with "/".

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:include</span></samp><dd>Only include items matching a regexp when publishing.  The regexp should
usually begin with "/".

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:path</span></samp><dd>The directory in which to store published files.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">:timestamps</span></samp><dd>A file containing the timestamps (that is, time of creation) for files
in this project.  It might eventually used by the <samp><span class="file">muse-blosxom</span></samp>
module, but this option is not currently in use by any Muse code.
