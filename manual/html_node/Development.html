<h3 class="section">3.2 Latest unreleased development changes</h3>

<p><a name="index-development-6"></a>
Choose the development version if you want to live on the bleeding edge
of Muse development or try out new features before release.

   <p><a name="index-git-version-control-system_002c-using-7"></a>The git version control system allows you to keep up-to-date with the
latest changes to the development version of Muse.  It also allows you
to contribute changes (via commits, if you are have developer access to
the repository, or via patches, otherwise).  If you would like to
contribute to Muse development, it is highly recommended that you use
git.

   <p>If you are new to git, you might find this tutorial helpful:
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html</a>.

   <p>Downloading the Muse module with git and staying up-to-date involves
the following steps.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Install git.

          <ul>
<li>Debian and Ubuntu: <kbd>apt-get install git-core</kbd>. 
<li>Windows: <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall">http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall</a>. 
<li>Other operating systems: download, compile, and install the source
from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/</a>, or find a git
package for your operating system. 
</ul>

     <li>Download the Muse development branch.

     <p>If you have developer access to Muse, do:

     <pre class="example">          git clone ssh://repo.or.cz/srv/git/muse-el.git muse
</pre>
     <p>otherwise, do:

     <pre class="example">          git clone git://repo.or.cz/muse-el.git muse
</pre>
     <p>If you are behind a restrictive firewall, and do not have developer
access, then do the following instead:

     <pre class="example">          git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/muse-el.git muse
</pre>
     <li>List upstream changes that are missing from your local copy. 
Do this whenever you want to see whether new changes have been committed
to Muse.  If you wish, you may skip this step and proceed directly to
the &ldquo;update&rdquo; step.

     <pre class="example">          # Change to the source directory you are interested in.
          cd muse
          
          # Fetch new changes from the repository, but don't apply them yet
          git fetch origin
          
          # Display log messages for the new changes
          git log HEAD..origin
</pre>
     <p>&ldquo;origin&rdquo; is git's name for the location where you originally got Muse
from.  You can change this location at any time by editing the
<samp><span class="file">.git/config</span></samp> file in the directory where the Muse source was
placed.

     <p><a name="index-updating-Muse-with-git-8"></a><li>Update to the latest version by pulling in any missing changes.

     <pre class="example">          cd muse
          git pull origin
</pre>
     <p>git will show how many files changed, and will provide a visual display
for how many lines were changed in each file.

        </ol>

   <p>There are other ways to interact with the Muse repository.

     <ul>
<li>Browse git repo: <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/muse-el.git">http://repo.or.cz/w/muse-el.git</a>
<li>Latest development snapshot: <a href="http://mwolson.org/static/dist/muse-latest.tar.gz">http://mwolson.org/static/dist/muse-latest.tar.gz</a>
<li>Latest development snapshot (zip file): <a href="http://mwolson.org/static/dist/muse-latest.zip">http://mwolson.org/static/dist/muse-latest.zip</a>
</ul>

   <p>The latest development snapshot can lag behind the git repo by as much
as 20 minutes, but never more than that.

<h4 class="subheading">Becoming a Muse developer</h4>

<p><a name="index-developer_002c-becoming-9"></a>
If you want commit access to the shared Muse repository, then register
an account at <a href="http://repo.or.cz">http://repo.or.cz</a> (be sure to add an SSH key), and
contact the current maintainer at <a href="mailto:mwolson@gnu.org">mwolson@gnu.org</a>.  It would be
best to send some patches to the <a href="mailto:muse-el-discuss@gna.org">muse-el-discuss@gna.org</a>
mailing list first, so that he knows that you know what you are doing. 
See <a href="Getting-Help-and-Reporting-Bugs.html#Getting-Help-and-Reporting-Bugs">Getting Help and Reporting Bugs</a>, for instructions on subscribing
to the mailing list.

   <p>You must also be willing to sign a copyright assignment for your changes
to Muse, since Muse is a GNU project.  The current maintainer will
assist you in this process if you contact him.

   <p>For information on committing changes to Muse and performing
development, please consult
<a href="http://emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/MuseDevelopment">http://emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/MuseDevelopment</a>.
