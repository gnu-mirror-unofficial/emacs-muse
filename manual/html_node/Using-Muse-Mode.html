<h3 class="section">5.2 How to Edit Files in Muse</h3>

<p><a name="index-editing-Muse-files-15"></a>
Muse Mode should automatically be activated when you visit a file with a
&ldquo;.muse&rdquo; extension.  One such file is <samp><span class="file">QuickStart.muse</span></samp>, which is
available in the <samp><span class="file">examples</span></samp> directory of the Muse distribution. 
You can tell that Muse Mode has been activated by checking for the text
&ldquo;Muse&rdquo; in your mode line.  If Muse Mode has not been activated, you
may activate it by type <kbd>M-x muse-mode RET</kbd>.

   <p>You will notice that Muse files are highlighted very simply.  Links are
colored blue, headings are large and bold text, and <tt>&lt;example></tt>
tags are colored in grey.

   <p>There are several different ways to edit things like links, which hide
the underlying Muse markup.  One way is to toggle font-locking off by
hitting <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>, which is also <kbd>M-x font-lock-mode</kbd>, make
changes, and then hit <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> again to toggle font-locking back
on.  Another way is just to move into the text and edit it.  Markup can
also be removed by normal deletion methods, though some side effects
might require a second deletion.

   <p>For the particular case of editing links, it is easiest to move to the
link and do <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd>, which is also <kbd>M-x
muse-edit-link-at-point</kbd>.  This prompts you for the link and its
description, using the previous contents of the link as initial values. 
A link to another Muse file may be created by hitting <kbd>C-c TAB l</kbd>. 
A link to a URL may be created by hitting <kbd>C-c TAB u</kbd>.  Links may be
followed by hitting <kbd>RET</kbd> on them.

   <p>If you want to add a new list item, this may by accomplished by hitting
<kbd>M-RET</kbd>.  This will put a dash and some spaces on the screen.  The
dash is the Muse markup that indicates a list item.  It is also possible
to created &ldquo;nested&rdquo; lists with this command, by adjusting the number
of spaces in front of the dashes.  If you have lists with long lines,
you can move to a list item and hit <kbd>M-q</kbd> to wrap it onto multiple
lines.
