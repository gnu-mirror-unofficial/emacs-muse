<h2 class="chapter">2 What is Muse?</h2>

<p>Emacs Muse (also known as &ldquo;Muse&rdquo; or &ldquo;Emacs-Muse&rdquo;) is an authoring
and publishing environment for Emacs.  It simplifies the process of
writing documents and publishing them to various output formats.

   <p>Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for authoring
documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of publishing
styles for generating different kinds of output.

   <p>What makes Muse distinct from other text-publishing systems is a modular
environment, with a rather simple core, in which "styles" are derived
from to create new styles.  Much of Muse's overall functionality is
optional.  For example, you can use the publisher without the
major-mode, or the mode without doing any publishing; or if you don't
load the Texinfo or LaTeX modules, those styles won't be available.

   <p>The Muse codebase is a departure from emacs-wiki.el version 2.44. The
code has been restructured and rewritten, especially its publishing
functions.  The focus in this revision is on the authoring and
publishing aspects, and the "wikiness" has been removed as a default
behavior (available in the optional <samp><span class="file">muse-wiki</span></samp> module).  CamelCase
words are no longer special by default.

   <p>One of the principal aims in the development of Muse is to make it very
easy to produce good-looking, standards-compliant documents.
